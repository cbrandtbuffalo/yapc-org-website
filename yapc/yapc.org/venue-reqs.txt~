Yet Another Perl Conference (YAPC) is an inexpensive, grassroots
conference on the Perl programming language aimed at beginners and
experts alike, organized by Yet Another Society, Inc., a non-profit
corporation. It traditionally lasts three days, with the first day
being comprised largely of tutorials, and the latter two of workshops
and seminars.

YAPC requires the following facilities:

*) Facilities.

   Auditorium. A large lecture-hall style room, with seating, capable
   of holding the full assembly.

   Meeting rooms. Three additional rooms with a total capacity
   approximately equal to that of the full assembly.

   Dining Area. A dining area capable of seating the full assembly
   for dinner.  The area should have a public-address system, although
   Yet Another Society may provide it.  It may be off-site, but must
   be near.

   Common area.  A common area in which groups of attendees can
   informally meet and in which conference registration can take
   place, and a number (6 or so) tables for registration and
   information booths.

   Terminal room. A room capable of holding approximately 15
   computers, to be used as a terminal room.  This room must have an
   internet network connection available to host some 10-20 computers.

   Storage. A secure room in which to store supplies, including
   materials for all the attendees and all necessary equipment.

   All facilities should be accessible by disabled persons, and held
   in controlled temperature environments (air-conditioned or heated
   as needed).

*) Catering.

   Catering services: continental breakfast, snacks, and a light lunch
   for three days, plus one evening reception and one sit-down dinner.
   About 25% of attendees will be vegetarian and 5% vegan; some may
   require lactose-free or low-carbohydrate meals.  The budget will
   determine the number and type of meals to be provided.

*) Accomodation.

   Inexpensive dormitory-style accommodations for approximately 200
   people. Previous conferences have been at Carnegie Mellon
   University, and inexpensive (US $30/night) accommodations have
   become an expectation of some attendees. If the facility does not
   offer accommodation, Yet Another Society may arrange with a local
   university or hostel for accommodations. Ethernet (wired or
   wireless) capabilities, and telephones, are desirable but not
   required, as are linens and towels.

   Nearby commercial hotels, restaurants, and social venues should 
   be available.

*) Equipment: A/V, Network

   The auditorium and three meeting rooms must have public-address
   systems, data projectors, transparency projectors, and both wired and
   wireless Ethernet. It may be possible for Yet Another Society to
   provide data projectors and wireless Ethernet if they are not
   available in the room. Dedicated Internet addresses are not required
   (DHCP or NAT are both acceptable) but an unfiltered connection to the
   Internet is required. 

   The terminal room must have at least one Ethernet connection
   (ideally 100baseTX Fast Ethernet) and sufficient AC power to
   provide power to fifteen computers and monitors. The terminal room
   (affectionately known as the Email Garden) requires eight to ten
   folding tables and about 25 chairs.  Preferably, there would also
   be working networked computers in place, but these may be arranged
   by the Yet Another Society.

   Wireless access (802.11b) may be present or provided by Yet Another 
   Society.

*) Transportation.  

   Nearby access to an Airport, preferrably a large one.  Parking
   facilities or arrangements, as appropriate.  How to arrive by
   public transport and taxi from the airport, or other major points.
