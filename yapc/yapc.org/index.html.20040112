<h2>YAPC::NA::2004 Call For Participation</h2>

Time to start thinking about those YAPC::NA::2004 presentations for June! I'm pleased to announce the official <a href="http://yapc.org/America/cfp.shtml">call for participation</a> for <a href="http://yapc.org/America/">YAPC::North::America in Buffalo</a>. We're accepting abstracts for everything from 5-minute Lightning Talks to half-day tutorials. See the <a href="http://yapc.org/America/">YAPC::NA::2004</a> site for details. The deadline is March 27, 2004. Looking ahead, we'll have registration and accommodation details in February.

<H2>YAPC::Israel::2004 - Last Call for Proposals</H2> 
                                                                                                                      
On 26th of February, 2004 <a href=http://www.perl.org.il/>Israel.pm</a> is                                            
going to have its second annual Perl conference                                                                       
<a href=http://www.perl.org.il/YAPC/2004/>YAPC::Israel::2004</a>.                                                     
We would be glad to see many visitors and speakers from overseas to                                                   
make our conference even better than it was in May 2003.                                                              
The dead-line for talk proposals is very close. You have to submit the                                                
abstract by <strong>30th November, 2003</strong>. You can do so after                                                 
registering on the web site.     

<H2>Oct. 21, 2003 YAPC::NA::2004 Dates Set</H2>

The dates for <a href="http://www.yapc.org/America/">YAPC::NA::2004</a> have been set, and through some special celestial manipulation they are exactly the same as last year! (Actually, we just moved it to the end of the week so it will be Wednesday - Friday.) So mark your calendars for Wednesday - Friday, June 16-18, 2004 and plan to be in Buffalo.

<H2>July 31, 2003 YAPC::NA 2004 Call for Venue Reminder</H2>

Just a friendly reminder that the August 1st Call for Venue deadline is almost upon us. At this point only one proposal has materialized, with whispers of others in the works.
<p>
The YAPC::NA Conference Committee is planning to choose the 2004 venue, in roughly two weeks (August 15th).  This date will be flexible enough to insure that all interested parties have enough time to finalize submissions.
<p>
If you have any questions or need feedback on your proposal, send e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:yapc-venues@yetanother.org">yapc-venues@yetanother.org</a>.  Good Luck!


<h2>YAPC::EU::2004 Venue Chosen</h2>
The YAPC Europe Committee has selected Belfast, Northern Ireland                                                      
as the location for YAPC::Europe 2004.  An excellent proposal was                                                     
also received from Copenhagen.pm, and we hope they will consider                                                      
giving a proposal for 2005.  We're looking forward to seeing you                                                      
in Belfast next year!  

<h2>YAPC::NA::2004 Call For Venues</h2>
With YAPC::NA::2003 over, it's time to get ready for YAPC::NA::2004,                                                  
and that means it's time to throw open the call for venues for next                                                   
year's YAPC.                                                                                                          
<p>                                                                                                                      
You can get details on what YAPCs entail in both YAPC.pm, on CPAN, and                                                
at <a href="http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt">http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt</a>. When making your proposal, in                                                  
addition to venue information and dates, do please make sure to                                                       
include details on airport locations, local public transit (as well as                                                
transit to the venue from the airport!), local cultural attractions,                                                  
and accommodation information. (See the docs for more details) The                                                    
more information you provide, within reason, the better.                                                              
<p>                                                                                                                      
Send the proposals to <a href="mailto:yapc-venues@yetanother.org">yapc-venues@yetanother.org</a>. Proposals are due by                                                
Friday, August 1st 2003, with a decision due two weeks later on August                                                
15th 2003. (If the summertime vacation blahs catch everyone out we may                                                
extend the deadline. Don't count on that) This gives about 7 weeks,                                                   
which is short but manageable, and should still fit within most                                                       
college and university scheduling requirements.
