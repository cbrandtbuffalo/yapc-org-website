<h1>Yet Another Perl Conference</h1>
</center>

The Yet Another Perl Conferences (YAPCs) are grassroots symposia on
the Perl programming language under the auspices of the <a
href="http://yetanother.org/">Yet Another Society</a> (<a
href="http://yetanother.org/">YAS</a>), a non-profit corporation for
the advancement of collaborative efforts in computer and information
sciences.
