YAPC - Yet Another Perl Conference information and documentation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Organize an open source conference.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains documentation and some support code for proposing,
planning, and executing a technical conference.  While the specifics
are relevant to a series of conferences supported by the Yet Another
Society, the content may be informative for any group with an interest
in promoting collaborative efforts and discussion on a focused 
technical topic.  

The intended audience is a small but dedicated crew that would intend
to take on such an event as the Yet Another Perl Conference, a
grass-roots conference and symposium series on the Perl programming
language.  These conferences have been carried out in a stronghold of
interest by small local core groups, with the aid of the local users
groups and members of the community.

=head1 SELECTING SITES

=head2 General Criteria

After you have a list of potential sites and you've gotten some detail
on them, ask yourself some questions to narrow it down:

=over

=item *

Would I choose this if I were on the selection committee?

=item *

Would I personally want to go there?

=item *

Which would be easiest for me to work as coordinator?

=head1 Preparing and Organizing the Conference

=head2 High Level Overview

At its core, hosting a YAPC is providing a location for members of the Perl community to get together. Although YAPCs have grown to include many other features, this is the main goal. Given this, there are a few things you must have ready, at a minimum, to make YAPC happen:

=over

=item * A venue

This is the place where everyone will get together for the sessions.

=item * Accommodations for attendees

This is where everyone will stay. A primary conference hotel and a less expensive dorm-style option are usually provided. Although in a pinch, people can fend for themselves, there is often quite a bit of unofficial gathering at the hotel and this can't happen if people are staying at different places.

=item * Speakers

These are the people who will give the presentations that the attendees want to see. It is best if you can get some people well-known in the Perl community because this will drive attendance.

=item * Attendees

These are the people who will attend the conference. To get them to come, you need all of the above in place and you need to communicate it so the attendees know all the details.

=back

That's it. The rest is really gravy--quite a bit of important gravy--but just gravy. When you are planning a YAPC, keep this list in mind. These are your "big rocks" and if you are spending a ton of time on something and one of these are not done, you need to reconsider your priorities. On the flip side, if you have all of these in place, don't stress too much if something else falls through.

=head2 Conference Timeline

Below are the main events in the conference life-cycle. Refer to this as you prepare for the conference to make sure you are on track and haven't missed anything. Refer to the remaining documentation for details on each step.

XXX Note: you need to time the end date for presentations in line with registration to allow people to see the program. Also deal with the question of registration/payment for speakers.

=head2 Conference Planning Team and Responsibilities

=head3 Responsibilities of the Primary Organizer

Most of this document uses the familiar 'you' when referring to tasks. However, if you are the primary organizer, this really means them. Pulling off a YAPC really requires that you have a team of dedicated people helping you. If you don't have a team of helpers, you really need to get one.

Ask your local Perl Mongers group to get involved. Ask on the YAPC list for things that can be done remotely. As the event approaches, your goal is to have no tasks assigned to you (or very few). That way, you can jump in and help with whatever needs attention without abandoning something. You need to be the project manager, directing the tasks and reviewing the work, but not doing much yourself. Believe me, just coordinating things will take up plenty of your time.

YAPC in Buffalo had 4 coordinators in the main group working throughout the planning process and about 20+ volunteers during the conference. In Toronto, nearly all of the Toronto.pm members helped with planning and execution, and this was between 15 and 20 people. Remember, many hands make light work (as long as you are coordinating and the hands know what to do).

Above all, don't be a martyr. This event should be fun for you, your team, and everyone else involved.

=head2 Picking the Venue

=head3 Venue Cost

YAPC is a grass-roots conference and we do everything we can to keep costs low. This allows people like open source developers to attend on a limited budget. Depending on how things go, the venue is likely to be your highest cost item and it can exert significant pressure on your attempt to keep the cost down.

As an organization, TPF basically has two choices with regard to venues:

=over

=item 1) Work all of our connections and get venues donated or offered for very low cost because of our status as a not-for-profit.

=item 2) Book with standard conference venues and charge high attendance fees to support the venue.

=back

Thus far, we have been able to get by with option 1 and we'd like to keep it that way. The conferences committee will certainly take this into account when selecting the host group each year.

=head3 Booking the Venue

Before you submit your bid, you are going to need to do a considerable amount of research into venues. This venue information will then be included in your bid. However, since you don't know if you are going to win the bid, you can't actually book the venue.

When you are investigating venues make sure you find out the following:

=over

=item * What is required to book the venue? Deposit, signatures, insurance, etc.

=item * How long before the event you can book?

=item * Is someone else looking at your dates?

=back

Once you win the bid, one of your first tasks is to book the venue and that should be easy if you have the answers to the above.

Why is this so important? Several YAPCs have had venues booked based on verbal commitments only to have things fall through because of mis-understandings. Get as much information as possible to avoid this.

=head3 Backup

When you are preparing your bid, you will likely investigate many different venues in your area. After you and your group rank your list and you pick your top choice, get all of the same information on number 2 as well. This will give you a backup plan if the initial venue falls through. And it's much easier to go ahead with your second choice if you already have all of the information.

Several YAPCs have had the primary venue fall through, so please don't skip this step.

=head2 Attendee Accommodations

=head3 Hotel

You'll need to designate a hotel as the primary conference hotel. People like to congregate and even if the hotel isn't right next to the venue, if you assign one that's where everyone will go.

If the hotel isn't immediately adjacent to the venue, you need to work out all the details to get people from the hotel to the venue and back.

When you pick the hotel, the most important points are internet access and price.

=head3 Dorms or Dorm-style Housing



=head2 Food and Beverages

=head3 Lunches

If you don't know the area around the venue well, start with Google Maps and create a map with key points such as restaurants, drug stores, grocery stores, etc. marked. Then make a road-trip with your team and scout things out. See if things are really there and are within walking distance.

=head3 Conference Dinner and Auction

I recommend going with the on-campus event. Make it easy for people.

Regardless of the venue, some people won't come to the dinner and some will leave after the dinner. Even on the boat, many people didn't participate in the auction even though they were a captive audience.

People want an opportunity to hang out, talk perl, and help out by bidding on cool books. Your campus option provides all of those.

As far as numbers, I think most do attend the dinner, but not all. I don't have firm numbers for you and caterers often need a firm number. We asked during check-in if the person planned on attending the dinner. Also, you might want to collect dietary preferences. You'll have some veggies, some vegans, and one or two kosher, and possibly some food allergies. Keep this in mind for any other food items too.

=head1 Budgets and Money

=head2 Registration Fees

One source of income is the registration fee. Ideally you want this fee to cover the per-person costs so the attendee is, at least, paying their way for your attendee-imposed expenses. So one way to come up with a fee is to add up your costs on a per-attendee basis.

YAPC has kept this at the very low $85 for many years, and the goal of many of the tips offered in this document is to keep that price point as low as possible. We don't every want the registration fee to be a barrier to someone coming. The low fee also opens the door to students and other non-corporate types who want to get a taste of what Perl is all about.

=head3 Exemptions

Typically presenters and keynote speakers are given free registration, since that's all we really have to offer. However, talks can be a continuum that range from a 5-minute lightning talk to a full day seminar. So you need to decide what your cut-off is. One system might be:

  Keynotes: free
  Talks 20 minutes or more: free
  Talks less than 20 minutes, including lightning talks: full registration

Around the 20 minute talk area, if the speaker is only doing one 20-minute talk, you might consider charging. This is an area with some flexibility.

You may also want to grant free registration to some of your volunteers. Note that you are incurring cost for all of these people for things like food, a t-shirt, etc. so don't grant free admission to everyone. Save it as a reward for volunteers who helped consistently, meaningfully, and throughout the planning process.

Any profits from YAPC benefit The Perl Foundation, so you can mention to all of the groups above that if they choose to pay, you'll let them. In some cases they'll be happy to pay their way and allow some extra money to trickle to TPF.

=head2 Sponsorship

Corporate sponsorship is used to lower the cost of participation and
raise the quality of the services offered, in return for good will,
recognition, and the ability to help create the atmosphere where
conversations can flourish, and keep the endeavor vital.

=head1 RUNNING THE CONFERENCE

=head2 Opening Address

You have a few responsibilities in your opening address:

=over

=item *

Thank your sponsors and everyone who helped. People gave money and time to
make your event happen. All they get is some recognition and the worst
thing you can do is forget them.

=item *

When you are done, thank your sponsors again. You can't do this too much.

=head1 HISTORY

The first Yet Another Perl Conference was held in Pittsburgh, PA at
Carnegie Mellon University in 1999, and had about 275 participants.
The event was attended by a small but mighty group of interested and
interesting Perl people, including Larry Wall, who delivered to
opening keynote on the first day of the two-day event.

The event was such a success that it was repeated, again at Carnegie
Mellon University, in 2000 -- and dubbed YAPC North America 19100, in
honor of all the "year 2000" concerns of the time.  Attendance was
some three hundred and fifty people.

Leon Brocard and Greg McCarroll took it on themselves to carry out the
first European YAPC in 2000 also, at the Institute for Contemporary
Arts (ICA) in London, with the theme "The Art of Perl."  Some two
hundred people attended, and volunteers from London and surrounding
areas helped in force.

In 2001, YAPC North America left Pittsburgh for Montreal, where 
Richard Lafferty and Luc St-Louis chaired the conference at the 
University of Montreal. About four hundred and twenty people attended.
Once again, local groups turned out in numbers to volunteer for
any and all tasks. 

The European YAPC went into another strong year with YAPC::Europe 2001
at Hogeschool Holland, Amsterdam, with a Security theme.  Ann Barcomb,
Jouke Visser, and a large and dedicated crew from the Netherlands,
created an excellent atmosphere for both talks and discussion, raising
the overall standard once again.
